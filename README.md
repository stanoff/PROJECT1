In this project, we aim to provide valuable insights to Microsoft's new movie studio by conducting exploratory data analysis on the current trends in the box office. As Microsoft ventures into the world of original video content, it is crucial to understand the factors that contribute to the success of films. By analyzing various attributes such as genre, gross earnings, and ratings, we will uncover patterns and correlations that can guide the decision-making process for the creation of successful movies.
